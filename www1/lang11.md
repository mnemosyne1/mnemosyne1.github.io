In computer programming,  assembly language (alternatively assembler language[1] or symbolic machine code),[2][3][4] often referred to simply as assembly and commonly abbreviated as ASM or asm, is any low-level programming language with a very strong correspondence between the instructions in the language and the architecture's machine code instructions.[5] Assembly language usually has one statement per machine instruction (1:1), but  constants, comments, assembler directives,[6] symbolic labels of, e.g., memory locations, registers, and macros[7][1] are generally also supported.

The first assembly code in which a language is used to represent machine code instructions is found in Kathleen and Andrew Donald Booth's 1947 work, Coding for A.R.C..[8] Assembly code is converted into executable machine code by a utility program referred to as an assembler. The term "assembler" is generally attributed to Wilkes, Wheeler and Gill in their 1951 book The Preparation of Programs for an Electronic Digital Computer,[9] who, however, used the term to mean "a program that assembles another program consisting of several sections into a single program".[10] The conversion process is referred to as assembly, as in assembling the source code. The computational step when an assembler is processing a program is called assembly time.

Because assembly depends on the machine code instructions, each assembly language[nb 1] is specific to a particular computer architecture.[11][12][13]
